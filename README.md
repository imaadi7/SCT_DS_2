# 🚢 SCT_DS_2 – Titanic Survival Prediction

This is Task 2 of the SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship.

In this task, I built a Machine Learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a classic Titanic dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
